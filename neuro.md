    c.  the resting membrane permeability to chloride.
    d.  the resting membrane permeability to organic anions.


97.  The resting neuron is sometimes referred to as a


    a.  sodium battery, because sodium drives the action potential.
    b.  calcium battery, because calcium is necessary for synaptic transmission.
    c.  sodium battery, because sodium is excluded from the cell.
   *d.  potassium battery, because the resting potential is nearly proportional
        to external K+ concentration.


98.  Ignoring constants, it is accurate to say that the Goldman equation


   *a.  allows you to calculate the membrane potential for a neuron, based on 
        the concentrations and permeabilities of the major ions.

        on the concentrations of the major ions.
    c.  allows you to calculate the equilibrium potential for an ion, based on 
        the concentrations and permeabilities of the ion.
    d.  allows you to calculate the equilibrium potential for an ion, based 
        only on the concentrations of the ion.


99.  Extracellular recording is so called because


    a.  two electrodes are used, one being called the "extra" electrode.
    b.  such recordings are from more than one (the "extra") nerve cell.
   *c.  such recording requires placement of the electrodes extracellular to 
        the nerve cell.
    d.  extracellular refers to the glia in the extracellular space.


100.  If one records extracellularly with two wire electrodes from an axon while 
    one replaces the normal extracellular fluid with saline with a high 
    potassium content, one would see (consider all options before you select 
    the best one)


    a.  a shift in the membrane potential (Em) toward zero, because the 
        increased K+ would depolarize the axon.
    b.  no shift in Em because no shift takes place.
    c.  a shift in Em away from zero because the increased K+ would 
        hyperpolarize the axon.
   *d.  no shift in Em because one cannot record Em by using this kind of 
        extracellular recording.

103.  Increasing the external concentration of potassium to twice its normal 
    level around a squid giant axon will


    a.  do nothing to the membrane potential because disturbing the equilibrium
        potential cannot affect the membrane potential of the cell.
    b.  increase the membrane potential (hyperpolarize the cell) because the 
        presence of extra potassium outside the cell will make the potassium 
        equilibrium potential more negative.
    c.  increase the membrane potential because the excess positive charge on 
        the outside of the cell makes the inside relatively more negative.
   *d.  decrease the membrane potential (depolarize the cell) because the 
        reduction in the equilibrium potential for potassium will mean less 
        potassium will diffuse out of the cell, leaving the interior more 
        positive than before.


104.  Cutting in half the external concentration of sodium around a squid giant 
    axon at rest will


   *a.  have very little effect on the membrane potential because the cell 
        membrane has an extremely low permeability to sodium.
    b.  decrease the membrane potential (depolarize the cell) because the 
        presence of less sodium outside the cell will decrease the activity of 
        the sodium-potassium exchange pump, leaving more positively charged 
        potassium inside the cell.
    c.  increase the membrane potential (hyperpolarize the cell) because the 
        reduction in exterior positive charge will change the potassium 
        equilibrium potential, allowing more potassium to leak out of the cell 
        and making the interior more negative.
    d.  decrease the membrane potential because the reduction in positive 
        charges around the outside of the cell leaves the interior less 
        negative relative to the outside than it was before.


105.  In most neurons, the internal concentration of K+ is about 10 times as 
    great as the external concentration.  If one then doubled the external

        appear at all.
    c.  all available ions contribute to the rise and fall of the action 
        potential or none do.
    d.  all synapses on a neuron must be active in order for them to excite it.


109.  One reason that action potentials are all-or-none is that


    a.  they are always the same size in a given neuron.
    b.  axonal membranes do not allow partial electrical responses to 
        electrical stimuli.
    c.  they must travel long distances without decrement.
   *d.  once the membrane potential is past threshold, the influx of Na+ keeps 
        driving it more positive until the maximum number of Na+ channels is 
        open.


110.  In a given neuron, action potentials are always the same size under normal 
    conditions.  This statement


   *a.  is true because the concentrations of the inward and outward flowing 
        ions don't change appreciably over time in normal cells.
    b.  must be false because it is known that AP's change size during 
        facilitation.
    c.  is true because action potentials are never recorded the same size 
        twice extracellularly.
    d.  must be false because the flow of ions during one AP changes the 
        concentration gradients enough to the affect the size of the next AP.


111.  A typical intracellularly recorded resting potential for a neuron is


    a.  about +54 mV
   *b.  about -60 mV
    c.  indeterminate, because you cannot determine the resting potential from 
        the Nernst equation, which would apply to the intracellular recording 
        situation.
    d.  nothing, because you cannot record a resting potential by using 
        intracellular recording.

        recharged, before another action potential can be generated.

        action potential.


119.  When cation gates (for positive ions) open during the rising phase of 
    the action potential, the influx of the ion is due to


    a.  the ion's concentration gradient, the membrane potential, the action of
        an ion exchange pump and the energy imparted to the ions as they pass
        through channels in the membrane.
    b.  the ion's concentration gradient, the membrane potential and the action
        of an ion exchange pump, only.

        axon.

        farther down the axon, thereby allowing the AP to skip parts of the 
        membrane.
    c.  myelinated axons are bigger than non-myelinated ones, and larger 
        diameter axons conduct faster.
    d.  the concentration of sodium channels at the nodes generates much larger

    *b.  false, because at that time rhythmic behaviors were thought to be 
        controlled by peripheral timing cues.
    c.  true, because no idea besides that of central control had been thought 
        of.
    d.  true, because at that time rhythmic behaviors were thought to be

    a.  a pacemaker cell that does not need sensory input.
    *b.  reciprocal inhibition between a pair of interneurons.
    c.  a command neuron with rhythmic output.
    d.  constant driving of one set of muscles, with periodic inhibition from 
        an oscillator to produce rhythmic output.

        excitation.

265.  One experimental approach to the question of whether or not a particular 
    neuron has access to (or is part of) a central pattern generator (CPG) is 
    to stimulate the neuron.  If the ongoing rhythm is

    a.  not reset, the neuron must be part of or have access to the CPG.
    *b.  not reset, the neuron must NOT be part of or have access to the CPG.
    c.  reset, the neuron must be a command neuron.
    d.  reset, the neuron must be a motor neuron.

266.  Some sensory feedback impinges on motor neurons, some on components of the 
    central oscillator.  One can help distinguish these alternatives by 
    comparing the effects of a stimulus on

    a.  the strength of the patterned motor output.  (I.e., does it get 
        stronger?)
    b.  the duration of the patterned motor output.  (I.e., how long does it 
        last?)
    c.  the completeness of the patterned motor output.  (I.e., does more of

    d.  the response of an animal engaged in a rhythmic or cyclic action to a 
        stimulus applied at one particular, fixed phase or time relative to the
        cyclic action.

268.  The observation that in a stick insect whose legs are loaded 
differentially
    (i.e., more on one side of the body than on the other) walking slows down 
    and normal stepping patterns are maintained, suggests that

    a.  the pattern generator(s) for walking are influenced by the visual input
        of the slowly moving treadwheels.
    b.  sensory feedback onto motor neurons can slow leg movements on the 
        unloaded side enough to keep the legs on the two sides in synchrony.
    *c.  sensory input from the loaded legs probably influences the pattern 
        generator(s) directly.
    d.  the pattern generator(s) for walking are able to maintain rhythmic 
        output even in the presence of improper sensory feedback.

    *c.  in a different but still coordinated pattern.
    d.  not at all, since the insect can no longer walk.

271.  In the experiment in which a shark was paralyzed with curare and its tail 
    moved back and forth, the purpose of the curare was to

    *a.  prevent movement due to muscular activity while still allowing 
        mechanoreceptors in the body to respond to externally imposed 
        movements.
    b.  prevent movement of the tail from disturbing the animal.
    c.  facilitate the natural expression of the swimming rhythm.
    d.  do none of the above.

272.  In the experiment in which curare was injected into a shark whose midbrain 
    had been severed, the purpose of cutting the nerve cord just in front of 
    the tail was to

    *a.  eliminate the possibility that grasping the tail would disturb the 
        on-going swimming rhythm.
    b.  prevent any sensory input that results from moving the body from 
        influencing the swimming rhythm.
    c.  keep the tail out of the experiment.
    d.  eliminate the influence of the pattern generators that were in the 
        tail.

    *d.  do nothing.


275.  The effect of wind on the side of the head of a flying locust is different 
    than is its effect on a standing locust

    a.  because the reflex effect of wind is gated by lack of tarsal contact 
        from the feet, preventing any effect of wind when the animal is 
        standing.
    *b.  because in order for them to fire, the motor neurons that respond to 
        the wind stimulus during flight require input from both the flight CPG 
        and the sensory hairs on the head that signal "wind on the side."
    c.  because the wings must be in the open position for wind to have any 
        effect, since sense organs in the bases of the wings inhibit the wind 
        effect.
    d.  for reasons not given above.

276.  Reflex modulation is defined as

    a.  the presence or absence of a reflex being dependent on whether or not

    *b.  the waxing and waning of a reflex depending on the stage in a cyclic 
        movement of some particular body part.

        to continuous change.
    *b.  reflex gating is essentially all-or-none while reflex modulation refers
        to continuous change.
    c.  reflex modulation occurs only in vertebrate animals, gating in 
        invertebrates.
    d.  none.  They are the same phenomenon
 278.  The selection and timing of individual muscles to be used in a rhythmic 
    behavior is carried out by the

    a.  executive functions of the CNS.
    *b.  execution functions of the CNS.
    c.  both the executive and the execution functions.
    d.  neither the executive nor the execution functions.

279.  In motor control systems, the so-called executive functions differ from 
     the functions of execution in that the former include

    a.  selection of muscles to be used in the behavior.
    b.  timing of activation of muscles to be used.

    c.  different groups of swimmerets to beat at different frequencies.
    d.  no effect (other than to cause beating of the swimmerets).

290.  Joe Premed is studying the nervous system of the cockroach and has 
    isolated an axon in a nerve connective.  He is very excited because he notices that 
    when he stimulates the single axon, the animal walks.  Previously, Joe  developed a 
    technique enabling him to destroy this axon in live animals.

    b.  at the neuromuscular junction.
    c.  in the siphon skin.
    d.  in the gill muscles.

145.  Habituation of  Aplysia 's gill withdrawal reflex is though to occur by

        junction.
    *b.  a reduction in the amount of transmitter released at the sensory neuron
        to motor neuron synapse.
    c.  an increase in central inhibition.
    d.  an increase in muscle fatigue.

146.  In the study of habituation of the gill withdrawal reflex in  Aplysia , 
the 
    idea that the behavioral change was due to a failure of the sensory neurons
    to respond to the stimulus was rejected by experiments in which, after 
habituation

    a.  direct electrical stimulation of the gill motor neurons resulted in 
        contraction of the gill withdrawal muscles.
    *b.  direct electrical stimulation of the sensory neurons showed that they 
        could still conduct impulses.
    c.  a strong dishabituating stimulus to the head allowed the withdrawal

148.  In order for a habituated reflex response to be dishabituated, the

    a.  weaker than the habituating stimulus, delivered at the same site as the
        habituating stimulus.
    b.  weaker than the habituating stimulus, delivered at a different site as 
        the habituating stimulus.

    a.  presynaptic inhibition.
    *b.  non-inhibitory presynaptic mechanisms.
    c.  REDUCTION in the amount of transmitter release.
    d.  only changes in motor neuron excitability.

151.  Sensitization in  Aplysia  is thought to involve the following sequence of 
    events

    a.  increase in cAMP --->  release of serotonin --->  blocking K+ channels 
        --->  more transmitter release.
    b.  spike broadening --->  more transmitter release --->  increase in cAMP 
        --->  blocking K+ channels.
    *c.  release of serotonin --->  increase in cAMP --->  blocking K+ channels 
        --->  spike broadening.
    d.  blocking K+ channels --->  spike broadening --->  more transmitter 
        release --->  increase in cAMP.

152.  In the study of the cellular mechanisms underlying sensitization, one 
step 
    in the series that leads to the increased synaptic efficacy is partial 
    blocking of a 

    a.  potassium channel, leading to a quicker (narrower) action potential 
        that releases more transmitter.
    b.  sodium channel, leading to a quicker (narrower) action potential that 
        releases more transmitter.
    *c.  potassium channel, leading to a broader action potential that releases 
        more transmitter.
    d.  sodium channel, leading to a broader action potential that releases 
        more transmitter.

153.  The role of adenylyl cyclase in sensitization in  Aplysia  neurons is

    a.  to activate the membrane-bound G protein, which in turn promotes 
        protein phosphorylation.
    b.  to act as a receptor for serotonin, the transmitter substance that 
        initiates the process.
    *c.  to promote the phosphorylation of proteins via synthesis of cAMP.

        potassium channels.

154.  Recent work has shown that in tissue cultures of  Aplysia  sensory and 
motor 
    neurons,

    a.  brief pulses of acetylcholine will produce short term but not long term
        potentiation.
    b.  electrical stimulation of the motor neurons will prevent the expression
        of sensitization.
    *c.  application of a protein inhibitor just before a brief pulse of 
        serotonin is applied prevents long term but not short term potentiation
        at the synapse.
    d.  protein inhibitors have no effect on the synapses formed between 
        neurons in tissue culture.

155.  Protein synthesis may be involved in the development of long-term 
    sensitization in  Aplysia .  This was shown by experiments in which 

    a.   Aplysia  could not remember being trained to avoid an electrical shock 
        after the administration of an inhibitor of protein synthesis.
    b.  exposure of the nervous system to an enzyme that speeded breakdown of 
        cAMP (an enzyme that required synthesis to be present in the normal 
        animal) resulted in an animal that withdrew its gill to any stimulus 
        anywhere on the body.
    *c.  an inhibitor of protein synthesis was added to a tissue culture dish 
        containing sensory and motor neurons, and serotonin pulsed at the 
        neurons just after the inhibitor was added could cause short-term but 
        not long-term sensitization.
    d.  serotonin squirted at sensory and motor neurons in tissue culture would
        not cause any effect at all after the neurons had been exposed to an 
        inhibitor of protein synthesis.

    *d.  long term potentiation.

157.  NMDA channels in the vertebrate brain differ from K or Q channels in that 
    only NMDA channels

    a.  are activated (opened) by glutamate.
    b.  allow K+ to leave the cell when they are open.
    c.  allow Na+ to enter the cell when they are open.
    *d.  are normally blocked by Mg++ ions.

158.  Depolarization immediately prior to synaptic activation of an NMDA-bearing 
    neuron seems to be important in the development of long-term potentiation. 
    This is because the depolarization 

    a.  is necessary for direct activation of protein kinases that mediate the 
        long-term effects.
    b.  causes a conformational change in K or Q channels that alters their 
        response to the presence of transmitter substance.
    c.  alters the equilibrium potential of certain ions, thereby affecting 
        their flow into or out of the cell, and consequently altering the 
        cell's response.
    *d.  moves Mg++ away from the NMDA-associated channel, thereby allowing ions
        to flow through it when it is opened by the transmitter substance.

159.  In the vertebrate hippocampal brain slice preparation,

    a.  learning-like changes in synaptic action have never been shown to 
        occur.
    *b.  cAMP levels in specific target cells have been shown to rise when long 
        term potentiation is evoked in those cells, but not when it is evoked 
        in other cells.
    c.  serotonin has been shown to be the transmitter that causes 
        sensitization at selected synapses.
    d.  the detailed neural circuitry underlying a complex learned behavior has
        been identified.

160.  Long term potentiation (LTP) in the vertebrate brain may require the 
action of a retrograde messenger.  The evidence for this is that

    *a.  more transmitter seems to be released from the presynaptic terminal 
        after LTP than before.
    b.  there is an increased size of the postsynaptic potential after LTP.
    c.  the presynaptic neuron is much more likely to fire action potentials 
        after LTP.
    d.  Calcium cannot enter the postsynaptic terminal in sufficient quantity 
        to bring about LTP without the action of some additional substance 
        released from the presynaptic terminal that helps remove Mg++ ions from
        the NMDA receptor.

    c.  brain hormone; eclosion
    *d.  eclosion hormone; eclosion

166.  In moths, the hormone that triggers molting from pupa to adult is called

    *a.  eclosion hormone.
    b.  ecdysone.
    c.  juvenile hormone.
    d.  brain hormone.

167.  In moths, eclosion hormone

    *a.  triggers molting from pupa to adult.
    b.  suppresses pupal behavior before the molt to adult form.
    c.  causes release of molting hormone.
    d.  does none of the above.

    *b.  pupal behavior --> eclosion behavior --> adult behavior.
    c.  adult behavior --> eclosion behavior --> pupal behavior.
    d.  pupal behavior --> adult behavior --> eclosion behavior.

169.  The switch from pupal to adult behavior in a metamorphosing silkmoth is 
    mediated by

    a.  brain hormone.
    b.  ecdysone.
    *c.  eclosion hormone.
    d.  juvenile hormone.

170.  If eclosion hormone is put on the isolated central nervous system of a 
pupa
    just ready to molt into an adult,

    a.  all nervous activity ceases.
    *b.  the nervous system begins to express the motor pattern of eclosion 
        after some minutes.
    c.  the nervous system begins to express the motor patterns of adult 
        behavior such as flying.
    d.  nervous activity shows a strong but random increase.

171.  In moths, the hormone which triggers molting from pupa to adult also is 
    necessary for the initiation of adult behavior.  This is shown by 
    experiments in which

    a.  the hormone was poured onto an isolated nervous system.
    *b.  the hormone was injected into "peeled" pupa before they would normally 
        have molted.
    c.  the brain was transplanted into the abdomen.
    d.  the brain was removed from the pupa.

172.  "Peeled" pharate moths (those that are just ready to molt to the adult 
    form, and whose pupal cuticle has been removed by the experimenter), 

    a.  will show adult behavior only after they have expressed eclosion 
        behavior.

        that normally triggers eclosion if they are injected with eclosion 
        hormone.
    c.  will never spontaneously show eclosion if they have been decapitated.
    *d.  all of the above.

thought
    to be mediated by

    a.  ATP.
    b.  brain hormone.
    c.  ACTH. 
    *d.  cGMP.

174.  The role of cGMP in the switch from pupal to adult behavior in moths is 
    thought to be that 

    *a.  it promotes the phosphorylation of two proteins that in turn presumably
        help make a population of nerve cells responsive to inputs to which 
        they were previously not responsive.
    b.  it acts via adenylyl cyclase to synthesize cAMP, which in turn 
        activates protein kinases that then cause alteration of the cell's 
        responsiveness.
    c.  it acts directly to shut down potassium channels, thereby making the 
        cell more excitable.
    d.  it promotes, via a G protein, the phosphorylation of proteins that then
        act to regulate the state of certain potassium channels.

175.  One function of eclosion hormone is to "turn on" adult behavior.  This is 
    suggested by experiments in which

    a.  the hormone is dumped on isolated nervous systems, which then show 
        eclosion behavior.
    b.  a pupa is induced to molt early by injection of the hormone.
    c.  headless pupae fail to molt.
    *d.  "peeled" pupae do not exhibit adult behavior until after eclosion 
        hormone is released and has induced molting behavior.

    *a.  no adult behavior is expressed until the moth has gone through eclosion
        behavior.
    b.  the moth never behaves like an adult.
    c.  the moth immediately begins to behave like an adult.
    d.  the moth behaves like an adult only after ecdysone has been injected, 
        but not otherwise.

177.  The phrase "programmed cell death" refers to

    a.  a fixed life span among different organisms.
    *b.  a fixed life span for some neural (and other) cells.
    c.  a gradual decline in the numbers of neurons in a mammalian CNS with age.
    d.  the change in morphology in certain neurons during metamorphosis in 
        moths.

178.  In a developing moth, programmed cell death is usually triggered by 

    *a.  reductions in blood ecdysone levels.
    b.  increases in blood ecdysone levels.
    c.  reductions in blood molting hormone levels.
    d.  increases in blood molting hormone levels.

179.  During metamorphosis in a moth,

    a.  all neurons are regenerated anew.
    b.  all neurons change shape and function.
    c.  some neurons die and the rest move to new locations in the nervous 
        system.
    *d.  some neurons die and some others change their branching patterns.

180.  The  most  influential factor controlling sexual behavior in mammals other 
    than primates is

    a.  the animal's genetic sex (XX vs XY).
    *b.  the animal's hormonal milieu (state).
    c.  the animal's social environment.
    d.  the animal's upbringing.

181.  Vertebrate sex hormones may exert their influence as much by inducing 
    specific neural growth as by activating specific neural pathways, as shown 
    by the finding that

    a.  a castrated neonatal rat will show female behavior if given injections 
        of estrogen.
    b.  female canaries can be induced to sing if given injections of 
testosterone.
    c.  specific regions of a rat's brain shows a high affinity of binding with
        estrogen.
    *d.  specific areas of a vertebrate brain are different in size in males and
        females, and this difference is linked to the presence or absence of 
        specific hormones.

182.  A male rat castrated at birth and given testosterone as an adult will not 
    exhibit normal male sex behavior.  This result is interpreted to mean that

    a.  testosterone is not broken down into estrogen in certain brain cells in
        the adult animal.
    *b.  testosterone has an effect on the development of the brain which must 
        occur before its behavioral effects can manifest themselves.
    c.  injecting testosterone in an adult rat is not adequate substitute for 
        the removed testes.
    d.  testosterone is not responsible for male sex behavior.

183.  Injection of substantial amounts of estrogen into an intact, newborn 
female
    rat produces a

    a.  super feminized rat.
    *b.  masculinized rat.
    c.  rat that exhibits both male and female behavior, alternately.
    d.  normal female rat.

(No. #184-186)

187.  One reason for believing that hormones may affect the DEVELOPMENT of the 
    brain is that

    *a.  removing the ovaries and injecting testosterone into neonatal female 
        rats can result in a male-like preoptic area in size and synaptic 
        organization.
    b.  the preoptic area of normal male rats is much larger than that of 
        normal female rats.
    c.  injection of testosterone in adult female rats masculinizes them.
    d.  removal of testes at birth produces a feminized rat.

188.  In mammalian brains, testosterone and estrogens act

    *a.  at highly specific and localized brain regions.
    b.  on the brain only at certain times of the month (i.e., they are 
        incapable of acting at other times, even if supplied).
    c.  at many regions scattered throughout the brain.
    d.  indirectly, each being converted to something else before exerting 
        their effects.

189.  Morphological studies have shown that mammalian sex hormones

    a.  have no binding affinities with any part of the brain.
    b.  bind equally well with all regions of the brain.
    *c.  bind strongly with certain localized brain regions, but not with others.
    d.  none of the above.

190.  Female canaries injected with testosterone develop an ability to sing.  
    This behavioral change is accompanied by

    a.  an increased ability to learn.
    b.  a reduction in the size of certain brain regions.
    *c.  an increase in the size of certain brain regions.
    d.  a strong tendency toward imprinting.

191.  Injection of testosterone into an adult male canary that is in the 
    non-singing phase of its reproductive cycle will cause

    a.  a rapid development of an ability to sing, but no change in the size of
        any brain region.
    *b.  a rapid development of an ability to sing, and an increase in the size 
        of some brain regions.
    c.  no change in the bird's ability to sing, but an increase in the size of
        some brain regions.
    d.  no change either in the bird's ability to sing or in the size of any 
        brain regions.

192.  In some song birds, testosterone has been shown to

    *a.  increase the size of certain brain regions, allowing the bird to 
        develop a repertoire of songs.
    b.  induce the development of songs, but without enlarging any brain 
        region.
    c.  enlarge the entire brain, but without inducing song development.
    d.  feminize male birds (i.e., suppress song development).

193.  Present evidence suggests that in canaries, seasonal variation in singing 
    in males in caused by seasonal

    a.  hormonal activation of otherwise static brain regions.
    b.  stimulation by seasonally receptive females.
    c.  suppression of the ability of males to sing.
    *d.  build-up (in cell number, cell size, and complexity of neuronal 
        branching) of certain brain regions.

194.  Seasonal increases in the sizes of certain brain regions associated with 
    singing in certain song birds is though to be due to

    a.  an increase in cell size.
    b.  a proliferation of new dendrites.
    c.  a proliferation of new cells.
    *d.  all of the above.

195.  Programmed cell death refers to the phenomenon in which neurons die 

    a.  as a result of the operation of some peculiar motor program.
    b.  when the animal of which they are a part dies.
    c.  at some specific time in the life cycle of the organism, irrespective 
        of any other, extrinsic factors.
    *d.  at some specific time in the life cycle of the organism, often 
        triggered by specific hormonal cues.
