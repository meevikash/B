A 57-year old male with a past history of high blood pressure awakens with a terrible headache. His eyes tend to drift about and when he is asked to track a pen moving to his left, both eyes move in short, jerky steps. In contrast, both eyes move smoothly when his eyes track a pen moving to his right. Given the patient's history, a radiological study is scheduled to determine whether a stroke had occurred. The study determines the area of infarction to include which of the following?

A. Left abducens nerve

D. Right temporal lobe

E. Left temporal lobe This answer is CORRECT!

Neurons in the left temporal lobe (middle superior and middle temporal gyri) are involved in detecting movement of objects in space and in guiding tracking eye movements during smooth pursuit. The left tracking movement is jerky because the frontal eye field is being used to guide the eye movement in saccades. The two eyes move to the left and if the object isn't in view, the eyes make another saccade to direct them towards the expected position of the moving object.
